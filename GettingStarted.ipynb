    "Causal Impact\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python package for causal inference using Bayesian structural time-series models. It's a port of the R package CausalImpact, see https://github.com/google/CausalImpact.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### What does the package do?\n",
    "This package implements an approach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign? Answering a question like this can be difficult when a randomized experiment is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "Given a response time series (e.g., clicks) and a set of control time series (e.g., clicks in non-affected markets or clicks on other sites), the package constructs a Bayesian structural time-series model. This model is then used to try and predict the counterfactual, i.e., how the response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had never occurred. For details, see: [Brodersen et al., Annals of Applied Statistics (2015)](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41854.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What assumptions does the model make?\n",
    "As with all non-experimental approaches to causal inference, valid conclusions require strong assumptions. In the case of CausalImpact, we assume that there is a set control time series that were *themselves not affected by the intervention.* If they were, we might falsely under- or overestimate the true effect. Or we might falsely conclude that there was an effect even though in reality there wasn't. The model also assumes that the relationship between covariates and treated time series, as established during the pre-period, remains stable throughout the post-period (see `impact.model_args[\"dynamic_regression\"]` for a way of relaxing this assumption). Finally, it's important to be aware of the *priors* that are part of the model (see `impact.model_args[\"prior_level_sd\"]` in particular).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the package structured?\n",
    "The package is designed to make counterfactual inference as easy as fitting a regression model, but much more powerful, provided the assumptions above are met. The package has a single entry point, the function `CausalImpact()`. Given a response time series and a set of control time series, the function constructs a time-series model, performs posterior inference on the counterfactual, and returns a `CausalImpact` object. The results can be summarized in terms of a table, a verbal description, or a plot.\n",

This is because we observed an average value of 99 but would have expected an average value of only 89. The 95% posterior interval of the average effect is [9.8, 11]. Since this excludes 0, we (correctly) conclude that the intervention had a causal effect on the response variable. Since we generated the data ourselves, we know that we injected a true effect of 10, and so the model accurately recovered ground truth. One reason for this is that we ensured, by design, that the covariate `x1` was not itself affected by the intervention. In practice, we must always reason whether this assumption is justified.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How do I cite the package in my work?\n",
    "We recommend referencing the use of the CausalImpact R package as shown in the example below:\n",

    "\n",
    "### How can I check whether the model assumptions are fulfilled?\n",
    "It's the elephant in the room with any causal analysis on observational data: how can we verify the assumptions that go into the model? Here are a few ways of getting started. First of all, it is critical to reason why the covariates that are included in the model (this was *x1* in the example) *were not themselves affected* by the intervention. Sometimes it helps to plot all covariates and do a visual sanity check. Next, it is a good idea to examine how well the outcome data *y* can be predicted *before the beginning of the intervention*. This can be done by running `CausalImpact()` on an imaginary intervention. Then check how well the model predicted the data following this imaginary intervention. We would expect not to find a significant effect, i.e., counterfactual estimates and actual data should agree reasonably closely. Finally, when presenting or writing up results, be sure to list the above assumptions explicitly, including the priors in `model_args`, and discuss them with your audience.\n",

    "### May the data contain missing values?\n",
    "The response variable (i.e., the first column in data) may contain missing values (`NA`), but covariates (all other columns in data) may not.
